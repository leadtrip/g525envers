## Grails 5 with Hibernate envers

A simple Grails 5 app with a single domain annotated with @Audited.

[Scaffolded views](http://localhost:10061/frame/index) are provided for the domain and a [separate controller](http://localhost:10061/frameAud/index) provides a view onto the tables generated by envers.

A domain is created and updated in Bootstrap creating an audit trail from boot.
